# Role Name

Install and configure the [Open Ondemand](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/) browser-based portal.

This uses the [osc.ood](https://github.com/OSC/ood-ansible) Ansible role to provide much of the functionality.

## Requirements

- The `openondemand` node, i.e. the node which will host the Open Ondemand server/portal must:
  - Have the slurm packages (e.g. `sinfo` etc) installed and be able to contact the Slurm controller (e.g.) - the easiest way is to ensure it is in the `login` node).
  - Have access to any cluster shared filesystems.
- Open Ondemand's authentication maps authenticated users (e.g. via OIDC) to local users on the `openondemand` node (see `openondemand_mapping_users`). You must therefore ensure that whatever is providing users for the cluster covers the `openondemand` node, e.g. if using `basic_users` role ensure the group for this includes the `openondemand` group.

## Role Variables

### Authentication
See the Open Ondemand [Authentication docs](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/authentication/overview.html) for an overview of the authentication process.

- `openondemand_auth`: Required. Authentication method. Currently only `oidc` is supported.
- `openondemand_mapping_users`: Required. A list of dicts defining mappings between remote authenticated usernames and local system usernames - see the Open Ondemand [user mapping docs](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/authentication/overview/map-user.html). Each dict should have the following keys:
  - `name`: A local (existing) user account
  - `openondemand_username`: The remote authenticated username. See also `openondemand_oidc_remote_user_claim` if using OIDC authentication.

#### OIDC authentication
The following variables are active when `openondemand_auth` is `oidc`. This role uses the variables below plus a few required defaults to set the `osc.ood: ood_auth_openidc` [variable](https://github.com/OSC/ood-ansible#open-id-connect) - if the below is insufficent to correctly configure OIDC then set `ood_auth_openidc` directly.
- `openondemand_oidc_redirect_hostname`: Required. The (external, as seen from the browser) hostname/IP which the OIDC provider should redirect the browser back to after authenticating, i.e. for the `openondemand` node.
- `openondemand_oidc_client_id`: Required. Client ID, as specified by the OIDC provider
- `openondemand_oidc_client_secret`: Required. Client secret, as specified the OIDC provider (should be vault-protected).
- `openondemand_oidc_provider_url`: Required. URL including protocol for the OIDC provider.
- `openondemand_oidc_crypto_passphrase`: Required. Random string (should be vault protected)
- `openondemand_oidc_scope`: Optional. A space-separated string giving the [OIDC scopes](https://auth0.com/docs/configure/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes) to request from the OIDC provider. What is available depends on the provider. Default: `openid profile preferred_username`.
- `openondemand_oidc_remote_user_claim`: Optional. A string giving the [OIDC claim](https://auth0.com/docs/configure/apis/scopes/openid-connect-scopes#standard-claims) to use as the remote user name. What is available depends on the provider and the claims made. Default: `preferred_username`.

### SSL Certificates
This role enables SSL on the Open Ondemand server, using the following self-signed certificate & key which are autogenerated by the `mod_ssl` package installed as part of the `ondemand-apache` package. Replace with your own keys if required.
- `openondemand_ssl_cert`: Optional. Default `/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt`.
- `openondemand_ssl_cert_key`: Optional. Default `/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key`

### Dashboard and application configuration
- `openondemand_dashboard_support_url`: Optional. URL or email etc to show as support contact under Help in dashboard. Default `(undefined)`.
- `openondemand_dashboard_docs_url`: Optional. URL of docs to show under Help in dashboard. Default `(undefined)`.
- `openondemand_desktop_partition`: Optional. Name of Slurm partition to use for remote desktops. Requires a corresponding group named "openondemand_desktop" and entry in openhpc_slurm_partitions.
- `openondemand_jupyter_partition`: Required. Name of Slurm partition to use for Jupyter Notebook servers. Requires a corresponding group named "openondemand_jupyter" and entry in openhpc_slurm_partitions.
- `openondemand_filesapp_paths`: List of paths (in addition to $HOME, which is always added) to include shortcuts to within the Files dashboard app.

### Monitoring
- `openondemand_monitoring`: Optional. Install the Prometheus [ondemand_exporter](https://github.com/OSC/ondemand_exporter) on the `openondemand` node to export metrics about Open Ondemand itself. Default `true`.

### Other
The [osc.ood](https://github.com/OSC/ood-ansible) role has some varibles 

- `openondemand_clusters`: Synonym for the `osc.ood: clusters` [variable](https://github.com/OSC/. ood-ansible#clusters). Default: empty mapping.

- `openondemand_servername`: Optional. Synonym for the `osc.ood: servername` [variable](servername) but with default of empty string rather than `localhost`. This defines the `ServerName` for the Open Ondemand [name-based virtual host](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#servername) and should therefore be the address the user goes to, e.g. `ondemand.mysite.org`. The empty string default set in this role is appropriate if accessing the Open Ondemand server by IP rather than hostname.

# Dependencies

- `osc.ood` role as described above.

- Note the `osc.ood: servername` variable is important, and has a default of "localhost" - this misconfigures name-based virtual hosting if using ip address and in this case you must set `servername:` to effectively undefine it.

# Example Playbook

See `ansible/portal.yml`. Note the `main` playbook should be run on the `openondemand` node (i.e. the node to configure as hosting the Open Ondemand server/portal), and the other playbooks should be run on some subset of the `compute` group.

# TODOs
- Support PAM auth (as default when `basic_users` is enabled?): https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/authentication/pam.html
- Support ways other than `openondemand_mapping_users` of setting [user mappings](https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/authentication/overview/map-user.html).
